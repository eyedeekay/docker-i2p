Unofficial i2p Dockerfile
=========================

This Dockerfile installs i2p from Debian sid, modifies it to let you access the
config interface from the host machine and runs it with nothing else changed.
It partly exists to be a way to map the i2p configuration pages.

This repository also contains a bunch of screenshots of the java i2p router's
web interface, automatically generated from near-defaults and run in a
container. The router these are attached to won't be running much, as I'm
deliberately publishing information from the router console. I'm doing it
because sometimes you need to circle something and write a note next to it.
Should you choose to use this image, your keys will be different from the keys
of the router in the images published in the screenshots.
